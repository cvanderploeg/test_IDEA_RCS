#### 2) Introduction
This document is a template that should be used for all software developments of ABT that are developed for the long term. The standards for software development within ABT are described in [Software development ABT](https://oosterhoffgroup.sharepoint.com/sites/KennisgroepComputationalSolutions/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?OR=teams&action=edit&sourcedoc={141057A7-BB1F-49C2-B85E-EDE73928AE2D}) . In this document it is mentioned how these standards are met, or on the contrary how they are met.   

<br/>

#### 3) Purpose
Briefly describe the purpose of the development

<br/> 

#### 4) General documentation
On the basis of a few questions, knowledge relevant to the use, development and maintenance of the software is documented. It is important to make this knowledge transferable by means of documentation. 

##### 4.1) Design principles
- What are important design principles for the development of the software?
- Has a readme been created in the repository?
- will the code be documented, if not explain why not.

##### 4.2) General specifications
- Is the code well documented and how?
- Is the name of the author and ABT as a company included in the code?
- Is there a legal disclaimer?
- Is there a manual for the users?
- Is there a change log present/maintained?

##### 4.3) Process specifications
- Is the code reviewed and by whom?
- Describe the release cycle processes and tests (non technical)
- Is there a platform for issue management use, and which one?
- Is the code on git? (duh)

##### 4.4) Technical specifications 
- What programming language(s) is it written in?
- What dependencies/packages have been used?
- Can the code be understood by another developer? What prior knowledge is required?
- Has the code been tested for functionality? If so, how?
- Have automatic tests been applied? If so, which ones?
